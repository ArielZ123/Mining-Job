Hi there, thank you for download my mining job here you can get all the information about the job.
#
About the job: you have two mining zones, one is for stones and the other is for rocks (in the mine shaft location) when the rocks value is the higher then the stones.
You have to get 15 stones / rocks to smelt them and then go to sell a pack of your smelted stones / rocks.
#
Script Features:
1) Mining effect - when hitting a stone / rock. 
2) The mine shaft in open until the day(23:00).
3) You need to have a pickaxe as an item to be able to mine.
4) sound when hitting the stone / rock.
5) Coming soon - HP losing in the mine shaft while mining.
If you have any idea you can suggest here!.

Script Settings:
Config.Lua - > will give you the option to switch between the old esx to the new one (esx legacy).
If you are using the esx legacy version please set the config to false and do the following thing: 
Go to -> fxmanifest.lua - > then go to -> shared_scripts and then add this line -> '@es_extended/imports.lua' under -> 'main/config.lua'.

Script Dependencies:
I placed over the mine shaft some stones props by codewalker so you need to download the ymap file from here: https://github.com/ArielZ123/Rocks
#
Sound system:
You need (Interact Sound) due to the sound effect: https://github.com/plunkettscott/interact-sound
You can use the sound file from the sound folder, and if you have a different sound system so go and do it as your system.

DONT FORGET TO LOAD THE ITEMS TO YOUR DB, PLEASE ADD YOUR DB NAME HERE: USE `DBNAME`; IN THE SQL FILE.
